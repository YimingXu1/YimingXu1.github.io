I am a Research Intern at Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences under the supervision of Dr. [Jing Yu](http://people.ucas.edu.cn/~jingyu). 
My research interests lie in the field of natural language processing, computer vision and machine learning. 

In particular, I tackle challenges of hard examples mining in Cross-modal Information Retrieval, where the goal is to increase the influence of hard examples on the similarity learning to improve the retrieval performance.
